Observation Post: Working at a Start Up

After working at a start up for almost three years; I made some natural observations that I would like to share. Most of them I have experienced before and other are new. My job Title is Quality Assurance Engineer(QA) and I work at Next generation Mobility where we provide a cloud-based solution to car-sharing and fleet management. The company is slowly transitioning to the growth stage in I’s development cycle. These observations are purely subjective.

Observation 1: Job Title
Earlier I mentioned my job title and it is in-fact my primary focus but in a startup all employees have multiple roles. Let get this correct, I don’t mean that working at a startup means you won’t do your job; I mean you will most likely have to go beyond your job title. Due to the fact that a startup does not have an abundance of money; emphasis is placed on motivation, flexibility, wand selflessness. Everyone works together and learn from each other. You will find developers taking on Human Resources task and even Human Resource Personal handling Quality Assurance tasks.

Observation 2: Job Change
Following up on the previous observation; if you prefer doing a certain Job after being exposed switching Job titles (Job title is being used lightly here). A startup has an all hands-on deck mentality most times, and the leadership would tend to assign you tasks you enjoy to get the most productivity out of you. IF you like ding Job B over you official Job description Switching to Job B is a matter of simply asking and showing interests.

Values:
This startup is about ideas and being able to deliver. Many of the values I observed helps this startup.

- Teamwork
- Open-minded
- Innovative
- Responsibility
- Integrity

Observation 3: Punctuality
A value which is held more on an individual level and this is one I hold dear. This one is more personal in nature and does not work well here. As one of the most valued resource of a startup is time and flexibility and you most work within the flexibility. If you fail to work within the time constraints you are considered to be unpunctual. And usually means that undo strain is being placed on other team members.

Observation 4: Teamwork and Open-mindedness
These two go hand-in-hand and I’ve been a member of several teams both good and bad. A well established and properly lead team can accomplish most task but that is a given. Where you can really see a team, shine is during times of hardships and unexpected challenges. A good communicative team will make light work of most of these challenges and even lighter work if the challenge presents itself again in the future.

Observation 5: Leadership and Transparency
Because Start Ups are small, understanding what is going on around you is easy to absorb. It is also up to the leadership to be transparent as possible and this does one thing. It builds trust; and as part of the team you begin to see and understand the vision of the leaders. This makes it easier to support, care, and give feedback on the cause.

Working at a startup is challenging and very rewarding as the challenges are frequent and the rewards are few. It takes a special group of individuals who work together to accomplish a same goal: deliver a product to customers they all care about hoping for growth.
