FreeCodeCamp - After Action Review

Two years ago, I decided to get more involved in programming, specifically with JavaScript. During my research I found FreeCodeCamp (FCC) and some other online platforms but in the end, I chose FCC because it was free and I could learn exactly what I wanted: Web development.

Web development covers a large array of technology which includes frameworks, libraries, and databases. FCC focuses on JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js or JMERN for short. On the way to earn your Full Stack Certificate you will also learn Git and D3.js. Note however, that you are not limited to these frameworks when completing projects as long as you use a JavaScript technology.

The Plan:
In order to earn a Full Stack Certificate, campers must first earn the Frontend, Backend, and Data Visualization certificates. The plan was to earn the Full Stack Certificate within 18 months which seemed doable if I allotted three months to each certificate.

What Actually Happened:
It took two years to earn the Full Stack Certificate. The work backlog began when Frontend challenges took three months longer than planned. After completing the Frontend and most of the Backend projects & challenges FCC revamped the curriculum. Over 400 new challenges were added but none of them were mandatory. Several new projects were and requirements were increased in order to be accepted passing. With the addition of new projects & challenges it only made sense that the number of certificates increasd as well.

Students must now earn six certificates in order to earn the Full Stack:

- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithm & Data Structures
- Front End libraries
- Data Visualization
- APIs & Microservices
- Information Security & Quality Assurance

Luck was on my side, many of the mandatory side projects that took up much of my time got transferred over. After checking everything I was only set back about two months.

There was also an opportunity at the company I work at to participate in a crash course. I took this opportunity but it set me back a bit as we had reading goals and assignment projects there as well.

One reason for not meeting my planned deadline was taking part in ‘fleetster University’. A code camp at the startup called Next Generation Mobility GmbH where I work as a Quality Assurance Engineer. The fleetster software is a cloud-based software with Corporate Carsharing, Public Carsharing, and fleet management solution. Over 20 years of combined programming knowledge was used to teach JavaScript, Ember and React to any participating member of the team. The intent was not only to share the knowledge but to improve the overall quality of the software.

This course was a four-month detour but it did help me to complete FCC. The projects became more complex and the four-month course at my company gave me more than enough know-how to finish those projects.

How can I/FCC improve?

- Plan every project, not just the big ones.
- Research more. I realized that I should have read on a topic more before attempting to complete a project.
- FCC should provide some sort of mentoring for campers who have reached a certain level.
- FCC should make some challenges mandatory as you don’t know which ones actually help you for a project.

Tips… (you will need some of them):
The following suggestions are for current and future students of FCC. They are in no particular order.

- Use Trello or a Whiteboard to plan and break down the projects. This is a have to as it helps to keep track and plan better. Once you have done it a couple times you always know what’s next. You should also add in research tasks for various topics e.g. things you don’t understand but is essential for completing the project.

- A simple web search with any search engine of the subject matter or error message will lead you to other developers that experienced the same issue. Also, pay attention to the date of the issue as some may be outdated and cause even more problems.

- Red the error logs/messages before attempting to fix the issue. There are two reasons for this.

1. The cause of the error might be obvious to you in the message.
2. After seeing the error multiple times and fixing it several times over and over again; it will bring you back to point “1”.

- “console.log” is one of your closest allies. One quick way to debug is to either log some data or a meaningful text message. Logging data will help you to determine if the data you are passing is correct. Sometimes logging some text helps you to determine if a piece of code is even reached when your code runs.

- Use FCC’s forums/StackOverflow/Gitter/specialized slack channels to ask questions when stuck.

- Extending from the previous tip; when asking a question provide ALL necessary information. This prevents the back and forth of asking for more details. The best is to either post your code somewhere publicly or use something like CodePen or Glitch.

- Use Git as soon as you can. Always create a new branch for every new functionality you are implementing. Don’t try to do everything on the master branch…all the time. This is more than good practice and will save you from restarting projects. Once you have set up the environment and completed your “Hello World” display; create a branch for whatever you are doing next. If you mess up and the branch cannot be saved it only takes a few seconds to create a new one from master.

- There is no manual on what’s next after finishing FCC and you will be motivated to practice your new skills. There are some options.

1. You can contribute to FCC or one of their other projects. The community is lively in the challenge and project forums but the project chat for their real-world project participation is on the quiet side. I had a couple interactions and even some accepted pull requests but it took some time. The tasks at the beginner level are either saturated with back and forth chatter of several campers trying to fix it, or there are no mentors to help through the others (specifically the side projects).

2. I mentioned before they added over 400 new challenges and believe me there are enough challenges to keep you busy for a while. You can always tackle those as they teach you different things.

3. Search Github for some opensource projects and contribute to those. But again, this is more for seasoned developers and only makes sense if the project you chose has some sort of mentor or maintainer.

4. Start a project of your own or solve a problem for someone who needs a solution. This is a good option to get the creative juices flowing and will most likely be the most fun. But even if it is fun don’t forget to plan it out.
