Short Observation Post: Working at a startup company

I’ve been working at the startup Next Generation Mobility GmbH for about three years and during that time I’ve made some observations. My title at the company, which provides a Cloud-Based car-sharing/fleet management solution, job Quality Assurance Engineer. The company is currently in the growth stage of the start-up cycle. Now I would like to share my observations with you but understand that these are anecdotal.

Observation 1: Your job title may not matter
As I mentioned earlier I work as a QA Engineer in a startup; but I’ve realized that this job title is just a placeholder. I don’t mean that working at a startup means you don’t always do what your job title describes. The low starting capital places things such as motivation and adaptability over most other aspects. Startups are mostly in uncharted waters which means the risks are high. You may find developers tackling on Human Resources tasks and Quality Assurance related tasks. Satisfying customers with a product that works and fast customer service are more important than sticking to the job title.

Observation 2: Opportunities.
Following up on the previous observation, it is easier to be exposed to other interesting jobs. The impressions one gets from other jobs can lead to one either appreciating his/her own job or the other. The high risks that startups take tend to push leaders to expose employees to do jobs that they a not familiar with. In turn the employee gains experience of a job that he/she may want to do in the long run.

Observation 3: Teamwork
One valued aspect for jobs at a startup is teamwork. We know a well-established and properly lead team can accomplish most tasks. The challenge is getting everyone to work together and ensuring that the team is well-greased. If team members don’t work well together confusion and arguments will ensue and nothing will get accomplished. This makes it hard to satisfy customers and keep customers.

Team dynamics are different and will change over time. Teams may be more disciplined/stricter while others may end up more Laissez-faire. No matter the style adopted it must be one that works for the different characters of the team. A well-greased team can undertake most challenges and be successful.

Observation 4: Transparency
Startups are small and employees being in-the-know is essential for its survival. If leadership fail to provide information some workers may lose interest through the lack of knowledge. Leaders should be transparent in-order to build trust and they should ensure that employees feel like his/her hard work makes a difference. Employees have a significant impact on the product due his/her knowledge of it. Therefore, if an employee is working without knowing the leader’s intent; the quality may be affected.

Working at a startup is challenging and rewarding as they are frequent. It takes special individuals to work together in order to accomplish a goal: Delivering a working product to customers in hopes of continuous growth.
