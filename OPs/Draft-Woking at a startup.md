Short Observation Post: Working at a Startup

I’ve been working at a Startup for about three years and during that time I made some observations. I work as a Quality Assurance Engineer at Next Generation Mobility GmbH which provides a Cloud-Based car-sharing/fleet management solution. The company is current in the growth stage of the if Start-up cycle. Now I would like to share the them; understand that these are anecdotal.

Observation 1: Your job title may not matter.
As I mentioned earlier I work in QA in a Startup; but this job title is just a placeholder. I don’t mean that working at a Startup means you won’t do your job; it means you will almost always work beyond the scope of your job description. The low starting capital places values such as motivation and adaptability over most other aspects. Startups are mostly in uncharted waters which means the risks are high. You may find developers tackling on Human Resources task and the latter Quality Assurance related tasks. To get something out to customers that works job titles cannot get in the way.

Observation 2: Opportunities.
Following up on the previous observation; it is easier to be exposed to other interesting jobs. The exposure one gets from other jobs understand another job. This can lead to one either appreciating his/her own job or the other. The high risks that Startups take may push leaders to exposing workers to other jobs to not to get the most of the them but to also expose them to that they may work better in.

Observation 3: Teamwork
One valued aspect for jobs is teamwork. We know a well-established and properly lead team can accomplish most tasks. The challenge is getting everyone to work together. ensuring that the team is well-greased. If the team members don’t work well together confusing and arguments will ensue and nothing will get accomplished.

Team dynamics of a team is different and will change over time. Teams may be more disciplined/stricter while other may more Laissez-faire end. No matter the type a well-greased team can undertake most challenges and be successful.

Observation 4: Transparency.
Startups are small and being in the know is essential; if leadership fail to provide information some workers may lose interest through lack of knowledge. Leaders at a Startup should be transparent builds trust, and ensures that employees feel like his/her hard work. Employees have a significant impact on the product due his/her proximity to the it. Therefore, if an employee is working with limited knowledge of the product; its quality may be negatively affected.

Working at a Startup is challenging and rewarding as they are frequent. It takes special individuals to work together in order to accomplish a goal: deliver a working product to customers in hopes of continuous growth.
