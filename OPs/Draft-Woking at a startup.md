Observation Post: Working at a Startup

Working at a Startup for almost three years; I made some natural observations that I would like to share. Most I have experienced before and others are new. My job Title is Quality Assurance Engineer at Next Generation Mobility GmbH which provides a Cloud-Based solution to car-sharing and fleet management. The company is slowly transitioning to the growth stage in its development cycle. The following observations are purely subjective.

Observation 1: Job Title
Quality Assurance is my primary job but in a Startup employees tend to be more flexible. Let get this correct, I don’t mean that working at a Startup means you won’t do your job. It means you will at some point work beyond the scope of your job description. Because of the low starting capital aspects such as motivation and adaptability are valuable. Startups tend to be in uncharted waters in their respected fields which means the risks are high. These tend to attract fewer potential employees and the employed need to fill in the gaps. You may find developers taking on Human Resources task and even Human Resource Personal handling Quality Assurance tasks. This is a much-needed learning and building phase as the company is putting itself together.

Observation 2: Occupation Change
Following up on the previous observation; it is easier to find your true passion when working at Startup. The exposure that one has to executing tasks from other jobs will help clear things up if something needs clearing up. It is not only the all-hands-on-deck mentally of a Startup but the leadership is also important here. Leaders must create opportunities for subordinates to challenge themselves. After being exposed to other areas outside ones own job description one can make a decision from there.

Observation 3: Teamwork and Open-mindedness
One of the most valued aspects for many different jobs and types of companies. We all know that a well established and properly lead team can accomplish most given tasks. The challenging part is putting a well-greased team together. After being on several teams myself the dynamics of a team can be different and will change over time. What I mean by this is that teams range from disciplined to Laissez-faire. And no matter where the team falls on the spectrum if it is “well-greased” the tasks provided to it will get done correctly.

Observation 4: Leadership and Transparency
Because Startups are small, understanding what is going on around you is easy to absorb. It is also up to the leadership to be transparent as possible and this does one thing. It builds trust; and as part of the team you begin to see and understand the vision of the leaders. This makes it easier to support, care, and give feedback on the cause.

Working at a Startup is challenging and very rewarding as the challenges are frequent and the rewards are few. It takes a special group of individuals who work together to accomplish a same goal: deliver a product to customers they all care about hoping for growth.
